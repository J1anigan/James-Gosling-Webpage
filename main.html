            <p>James Gosling OC (born 19 May 1955) is a Canadian computer scientist, best known as the founder and lead designer behind the Java programming language. James gosling recieved his bachelors from the University of Calgary, and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University, all in computer science. Gosling began his 26-year career at Sun when he was recruited by Sun cofounder Andy Bechtolsheim in 1984. An early project, done by Gosling and colleague David Rosenthal was the windowing system called SunDew, later renamed NeWS, the Network-extensible Windows System. NeWS was designed to work with bitmapped displays on workstations and was meant to be used across hardware platforms and operating systems but was ultimately abandoned in favor of X-Windows.

            <p><b>Java</b> is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on <b>Java</b>, as well. While most modern <b>Java</b> applications combine the <b>Java</b> runtime and application together, there are still many applications and even some websites that will not function unless you have a desktop <b>Java</b> installed. Java.com, this website, is intended for consumers who may still require Java for their desktop applications. The <b>Java</b> Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 is what you get when you download <b>Java</b> software from java.com. The JRE consists of the <b>Java</b> Virtual Machine (JVM), <b>Java</b> platform core classes, and supporting <b>Java</b> platform libraries. The JRE is the runtime portion of <b>Java</b> software, which is all you need to run <b>Java</b> WebStart applications from a supported web browser. It doesn’t come with development tools, though – these tools are part of the <b>Java</b> Development Kit (JDK).
